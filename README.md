> Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two paddles, cotrolled by players, with the goal of getting the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins. This version is built to more closely resemble NES than the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of resolutionm though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on modern systems.
